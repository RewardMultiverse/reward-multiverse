# Abstract
In recent advancements in text-to-image synthesis, fine-tuning diffusion models through reward-driven backpropagation has shown promising results. In this work, we introduce a framework for implementing and applying various reward functions to align text-to-image diffusion models according to specific visual characteristics. Our methodology involves training reward models capable of distinguishing unique image featuresâ€”such as the presence of snow, rain, and pixelateâ€”and using these models to guide the diffusion process towards generating images with desired attributes. We present a versatile tool that allows users to create custom reward models, facilitating personalized image generation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our reward models in producing high-fidelity, attribute-specific images. Our work not only extends the capabilities of text-to-image models but also provides a scalable platform for community-driven enhancements in image generation.
